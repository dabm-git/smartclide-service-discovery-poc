## Run
This script collects information from Programableweb, to avoid saturation and blocking of IP addresses by a high number of requests, this script can be executed on a regular basis, obtaining a section each time.

When launched, information is collected in batches that are exported to .csv files, and when a batch is finished, the results are merged under the same .csv file.
